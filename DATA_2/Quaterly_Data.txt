This dataset provides a detailed record of Freedom of Information (FOI) requests and their processing across Australian government agencies. It captures comprehensive quarterly and annual statistics, including requests received, outcomes, internal reviews, exemptions applied, charges, and disclosure log activity. The dataset serves as a critical resource for analyzing transparency, accountability, and efficiency in government information management.
Each row corresponds to a reporting period for a specific agency, including general administrative fields such as Report year, Quarter, Agency, and Administrating agency name, which identify the reporting entity and the relevant time frame. The Is agency active field indicates whether the agency was operational during the reporting period, and Date created marks when the report entry was generated.
Operational data include the number and type of FOI requests received, transferred, granted, refused, withdrawn, or responded to. Separate columns track personal and other requests, their timeliness, and responses categorized by how late they were processed. This level of detail allows for the assessment of agency performance in handling information requests and adherence to statutory timelines.
The dataset also records financial aspects, such as Total charges notified and Total charges collected, reflecting the administrative cost of processing requests. Internal review information is included, detailing the number of applications, outcomes, and whether decisions were fully or partially granted, or granted after deferment or in alternative forms.
Exemption claims are comprehensively tracked through sections 33, 34, 37, 38, 42, 45, 45A, 46, and 47 series, allowing insight into the legal grounds used to withhold information. Section 48 requests, which involve amending or annotating personal records, are also included.
Finally, disclosure log activity provides information on the number of log entries, unique visitors, page views, and alternative access explanations. These data points allow agencies to monitor public access to information and evaluate the effectiveness of disclosure practices.
Overall, this dataset offers a rich resource for researchers, policymakers, and auditors interested in government transparency, FOI performance, and public accountability. It provides a structured view of how agencies manage requests, exercise discretion through exemptions, and facilitate access to information.
